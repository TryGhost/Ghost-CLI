# Contributing to Ghost-CLI

Welcome to the Ghost-CLI project, and thank you for wanting to get started contributing!

To setup Ghost-CLI for development, please read through the developer setup in the [readme](../README.md).

Read through the list of [open issues](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-CLI/issues), and if you find one that you want to work on, please comment on it so that others will know it's being worked on ðŸ˜‰

Once you've implemented the feature or fixed the issue, please make sure:

- it passes tests (`yarn test`)
- all commits are squashed into one or two commits
- the commit message follows [this format](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#commit-message-convention-at-a-glance)

Then submit a PR and one of the core team will review it!

If you have any questions, feel free to drop by our [slack channel](https://slack.ghost.org)! We'd be happy to help ðŸ˜„

#### Note: If you wish to implement a new feature, it would be wise to open an issue about it beforehand. That way the Core Team can make comments and ensure that the feature is in the best interests and direction of the CLI.
